**Subject:** Question about [Manufacturer Name] custom build capacity

Hi [Contact Name],

I'm Ben, founder of Caravan Match. I'm currently working with a few buyers looking for custom builds in the [State/Region] area and noticed [Manufacturer Name] builds fit their specs perfectly.

Are you guys currently taking on new build requests for the second half of 2026?

I'd love to chat about whether we can send some of these leads your way.

Regards,

Hi [Contact Name],

Just following up on my note below. 

I'm currently mapping out manufacturer capacity for a few active buyers in our network. I wanted to see if [Manufacturer Name] is open to receiving new custom build leads at the moment?

If you're at capacity, no stress—just let me know so I can manage the buyers' expectations.

Cheers,

Ben
